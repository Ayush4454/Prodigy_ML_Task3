To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying cat and dog images from the Kaggle dataset, follow these steps:

1. Dataset Preparation: Download and organize images into cat and dog folders.

2. Image Preprocessing: Resize images to a uniform size and flatten them into vectors.

3. Feature Extraction: Use pixel values or techniques like HOG or transfer learning.

4. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. SVM Implementation: Import libraries and create an SVM model.

6. Training: Fit the model on the training data.

7. Evaluation: Predict on the test set and evaluate performance.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optionally use Grid Search for optimization.

9. Deployment: Save and deploy the model as needed.
